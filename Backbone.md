# Overview of Backbone.js

Released in 2010 from the creator of Coffeescript, Backbone.js remains one of the most popular client-side MV 'Whatever' frameworks with the largest support communities. Backbone is thought to be the most lightweight and flexible of of its peers, forcing less convention than Angular or Ember.

Backbone appears to be a great option for single page apps and excels in the itegration of RESTful APIs and client-side routing. Some of the notable sites developed with Backbone.js in recent years include:

## Backbone vs. Angular
Though thought of as an MV* framework, Backbone refers to itself as a library rather than a framework. One of the main ways Backbone differs from Angluar and other MVC options is in its lack of an explicit controller. The work of the controller in Backbone is handled instead by views and routers.

Backbone has been said to have a steeper learning curve for novice JS developers. Imposing less convention than other frameworks, Backbone is sometimes criticized for being more verbose and requiring the writing of more 'biolerplate' code to get things up and running.

A mere 6.5k minified and compressed, Backbone does have dependencies on Underscore.js library and optionally JQuery.

## Templating with Backbone
Backbone lends itself to use of templates for efficient rendering of data in views. By default Backbone will use the Underscore.js template engine however Handlebars or other templating options can be used.

## Backbone integration with Rails
Backbone can be easily integrated with Rails. Some great resources include:
